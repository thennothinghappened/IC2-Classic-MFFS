# Modular Force-Field System for IC2-Classic!

This is the repository for my MFFS mod rewrite for **1.12.2**, based directly on the work by Thunderdark and immibis.

As the source code was included for the version `rev7` as included in [Tekkit Classic](),
I used this source as a reference for some values - mainly for drawing the GUI - as this rewrite seeks to be as faithful
as possible to the original as we got in Classic; bringing it as-is to 1.12.2.

## Why???

The main motivation for doing so was the release of [Tekkit 2](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/tekkit-2.1935271)(!!).

Notably, apparently since I last worked on this,
Tekkit 2 now actually has an [MFFS mod](https://github.com/ACGaming/modularforcefieldsystem/tree/1.12), which on initial
glance looks to be based on the fork that used Universal Electricity back when that existed. Whilst I have no doubt
that's an excellent mod, being based off the newer UE-centric path of MFFS doesn't meet my wants personally for the
nostalgia-factor.

Given it's under the Lesser GPL, I may use it as reference for the force-field implementation going forward, given my
lack of Forge experience :P
